## Feature 1: Intelligent Leak Prediction üîÆ

### What It Does

Analyzes historical data to predict which equipment is likely to exceed EPA leak rate thresholds BEFORE violations occur.

### How It Works

The AI examines:
- **Leak rate trends** - Is the leak rate increasing over time?
- **Proximity to threshold** - How close is equipment to violation?
- **Compliance history** - Has equipment failed inspections before?
- **Equipment age** - Older equipment tends to leak more
- **Service frequency** - More repairs may indicate declining condition

### Risk Scoring

Each piece of equipment gets a risk score (0-100%):
- **70%+**: Critical risk - immediate action recommended
- **40-69%**: High risk - schedule inspection within 2 weeks
- **20-39%**: Medium risk - continue regular monitoring
- **0-19%**: Low risk - equipment performing normally

### How to Use

1. Navigate to **AI Features ‚Üí Leak Prediction**
2. View the risk analysis table
3. Click risk factors to see detailed analysis
4. Follow recommendations for each piece of equipment

### Business Value

- **Prevent EPA violations** (up to $44,539/day per violation)
- **Proactive maintenance** instead of reactive repairs
- **Reduce refrigerant loss** and associated costs
- **Prioritize inspection resources** effectively

### Requirements

- At least **2 leak inspections** per equipment for predictions
- More inspection history = higher prediction confidence

## Feature 2: Natural Language Service Entry üé§

### What It Does

Converts plain English service descriptions into structured database entries - no forms required!

### How It Works

1. Technician describes work in natural language
2. AI extracts structured data (equipment ID, refrigerant amounts, leak info, etc.)
3. User reviews and confirms the extracted data
4. Data can be saved to database

### Example Usage

**Input:**
```
Serviced AC-12 today, found leak at condenser coil, added 3.5 pounds of R-410A,
repaired leak with brazing, follow-up needed in 30 days
```

**AI Extracts:**
- Equipment: AC-12
- Service Type: Leak Repair
- Refrigerant Added: 3.5 lbs
- Leak Found: Yes
- Leak Location: Condenser coil
- Work Performed: Leak repair via brazing
- Follow-up Required: Yes
- Follow-up Notes: Check in 30 days

### Best Practices

**Include these details for best results:**
- Equipment ID or name
- Date (if not today)
- Technician name
- What work was performed
- Refrigerant amounts (added/recovered)
- Leak information (location, repaired?)
- Follow-up requirements

**Good Example:**
```
John Smith serviced refrigerator REF-5 on March 15th. Found leak at evaporator,
recovered 2 lbs of R-404A, brazed connection, needs verification inspection.
```

**Also Works:**
```
AC unit 12 routine maintenance, no leaks, added half pound R-410A
```

### How to Use

1. Navigate to **AI Features ‚Üí Quick Entry**
2. Type or speak your service description
3. Click "Parse with AI"
4. Review the extracted data
5. Continue to manual form to save (with pre-filled data)

### Business Value

- **5x faster** data entry (5 minutes ‚Üí 1 minute)
- **Fewer errors** - no manual form filling
- **Better adoption** - technicians prefer speaking to typing
- **Field-ready** - works on mobile devices

## Privacy & Data Security

### Data Sent to Anthropic

**Leak Prediction**: ‚ùå NO data sent to API (uses local algorithms only)

**Natural Language Entry**: ‚úÖ Service descriptions sent to Claude
- Equipment IDs
- Technician names
- Service descriptions

**Compliance Chatbot**: ‚úÖ Questions sent to Claude
- User questions
- System context (equipment counts, alert counts)

### Privacy Best Practices

1. **Don't include sensitive info** in natural language descriptions
   - ‚ùå BAD: "Serviced unit at 123 Main St for John Doe SSN 123-45-6789"
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Serviced AC-12, added 3 lbs R-410A"

2. **Equipment IDs instead of addresses**
   - Use internal equipment IDs (AC-12, REF-5)
   - Avoid customer names or addresses

3. **Review Anthropic's privacy policy**
   - Data retention: 30 days
   - No training on customer data (with API)
   - SOC 2 Type II certified

4. **For maximum privacy**: Use leak prediction only (no API calls)

## Troubleshooting

### AI Features Don't Appear in Navigation

**Solution**: Check that AI is enabled
```bash
# Windows
echo %AI_ENABLED%

# Should show: true
```

Set if not enabled:
```bash
set AI_ENABLED=true
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
```

### "AI features not enabled" Error

**Cause**: Missing API key or AI_ENABLED not set

**Solution**:
1. Verify environment variables are set
2. Restart the application
3. Check `.env` file if using one

### "Invalid API Key" Error

**Cause**: Incorrect or expired API key

**Solution**:
1. Verify API key at https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Ensure key starts with `sk-ant-api03-`
3. Check for extra spaces or quotes

### Leak Prediction Shows "Insufficient Data"

**Cause**: Equipment needs at least 2 leak inspections

**Solution**:
1. Add leak inspections via **Inspections ‚Üí Add Inspection**
2. Need historical data for predictions
3. Import past inspection records if available

### Natural Language Parser Not Working

**Possible Causes**:
1. API key not set correctly
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Anthropic API service down

**Solution**:
1. Check API key configuration
2. Test network connectivity
3. Check Anthropic status: https://status.anthropic.com/
